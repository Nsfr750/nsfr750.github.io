## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Optional backends for PDF rendering (Auto falls back safely):
  - PyMuPDF (fitz) — default and bundled via requirements
  - Ghostscript (for Wand) — install Ghostscript and set its executable path in Settings

See [PREREQUISITES.md](PREREQUISITES.md) for platform-specific setup.

### Install from source

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nsfr750/PDF_finder.git
   cd PDF_finder
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Click "Scan Folder" to select a directory to scan for duplicate PDFs.

3. Review the results in the main window. After a scan completes, the file list is automatically populated with the scanned PDFs and duplicate groups.

4. Use the tools to manage duplicates:
   - Mark files to keep
   - Delete unwanted duplicates
   - Preview files before taking action

## Key Features in Detail

### Smart PDF Comparison

- Compares PDF content using advanced hashing algorithms
- Detects similar documents even with different file names or metadata
- Configurable similarity threshold for fine-tuned results

### Performance Optimizations

- Multi-threaded scanning for faster processing
- Memory-efficient handling of large PDF files
- Progress tracking and cancellation support

### User Experience

- Modern, responsive interface
- Customizable view options
- Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts
- Detailed file information and previews
- Toolbar with improved spacing and visual clarity
- Settings dialog includes a "Test backends" button to validate PyMuPDF and Ghostscript availability

### PDF Backends and Fallback

- Choose your preferred backend in Settings → PDF Rendering
- Use "Test backends" to verify if Ghostscript are correctly configured
- If the selected backend fails, the app falls back to an available backend and shows a status-bar warning (localized)
