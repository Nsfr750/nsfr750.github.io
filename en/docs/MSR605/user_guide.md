2. Enter or paste the data you want to write in the appropriate track fields
3. Select which tracks you want to write to
4. Click the "Write" button
5. The status bar will show the result of the operation

## Card Format Support

The application supports two major magnetic card standards: ISO 7811 and ISO 7813. Understanding these formats is crucial for proper card reading and writing operations.

### ISO 7811

ISO 7811 is the international standard for identification cards with magnetic stripes. It defines:

- **Track 1**: Alphanumeric data (up to 79 characters)
  - Format: `%[format code][primary account number]^[name]^[expiration date][service code][discretionary data]?`
  - Example: `%B1234567890123456^CARDHOLDER/NAME^24011234567890123456789?`

- **Track 2**: Numeric data (up to 40 characters)
  - Format: `;[primary account number]=[expiration date][service code][discretionary data]?`
  - Example: `;1234567890123456=24011234567890123456?`

- **Track 3**: Read/write capability (not commonly used)
  - Primarily numeric data
  - Used for financial transactions and value updates

### ISO 7813

ISO 7813 is a subset of ISO 7811 specifically for financial transaction cards. Key differences:

- **Track 1**: More strictly formatted
  - Format code must be 'B' (banking)
  - Fixed field lengths for certain data elements
  - Example: `%B1234567890123456^CARDHOLDER/NAME^24011234567890123456789?`

- **Track 2**: Similar to ISO 7811 but with specific validation rules
  - Example: `;1234567890123456=24011234567890123456?`

### Selecting the Correct Format

1. Go to **Settings** > **Card Format**
2. Choose between:
   - **Auto-detect** (default): Automatically detects the card format
   - **ISO 7811**: For general purpose cards
   - **ISO 7813**: For financial transaction cards
3. Click **Apply** to save the settings

## Writing Cards

1. Select the tracks you want to write to
2. Choose the appropriate card format (ISO 7811 or ISO 7813)
3. Enter the data in the appropriate track fields following the selected format
4. Click the "Write" button
5. The application will validate the data and perform the write operation
6. The operation status will be displayed in the status bar

## Configuration

### Device Settings
- **Baud Rate**: Adjust the communication speed (default: 9600)
- **Parity**: Set the parity (None, Even, Odd, Mark, Space)
- **Data Bits**: Set the number of data bits (default: 8)
- **Stop Bits**: Set the number of stop bits (default: 1)

### Application Settings
- **Auto-detect Device**: Enable/disable automatic device detection
- **Start Minimized**: Launch the application minimized to system tray
- **Save Logs**: Enable logging of operations to a file

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Device Not Detected
- Ensure the device is properly connected to the USB port
- Try a different USB port
- Check if the device is recognized in your system's Device Manager
- Restart the application

#### Reading/Writing Fails
- Ensure the card is properly inserted
- Clean the card's magnetic stripe
- Verify the card is not write-protected
- Check the track configuration matches the card format

#### Application Crashes
- Ensure you have the latest version installed
- Check the log file for error details
- Try reinstalling the application
